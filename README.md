#  Welcome!
My name is Ella Morrissey and I am a junior at Lehigh University studying [journalism](https://thebrownandwhite.com/). I am using github for my data journalism class.

Using Canva to illustrate Lehigh University academic trends. I decided to look at undergraduate enrollment based on what college students are in. I was able to find this information on the [Lehigh University 2021 University Profile](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf)
