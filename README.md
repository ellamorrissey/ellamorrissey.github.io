#  Welcome!
My name is Ella Morrissey and I am a junior at Lehigh University studying [journalism](https://thebrownandwhite.com/). I am using github for my data journalism class.

## Using Canva to illustrate Lehigh University academic trends. 

I decided to look at undergraduate enrollment based on what college students are in. I was able to find this information on the [Lehigh University 2021 University Profile](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf)

## Using Canva to illustrate the gender wage gap in professional sports
I am passionate about women's sports and equality and was interested in looking more at the salary comparison between male and female athletes. Even though some sports such as tennis and soccer have made incredible strides in gender equity, there are still professional sports leagues in which the gender wage discrepany is over 90%. The infographic below shows the wage differences in 5 of the major sports from the 2019-2020 seasons, including the difference between the top paid male and female athletes. The data was provided by [Adelphi University's sports management team](https://online.adelphi.edu/articles/male-female-sports-salary/)

## Major Moments in WNBA History Timeline
I am a big fan of the Women's National Basketball Association and have attended many games over the years with friends and family. The WNBA has been around for about 25 years so I'd thought it be interesting to look at some major moments in the league's history. From its conception, to big plays and games by hall of fame players, it was interesting to see how the league has evolved over the years.

The Winter Olympics in Beijing, China lasted a total of 16 days and included 104 events. I decided to look at the best performing nations at the games based on how many medals they won. It surprised me the United States came in fifth place since they are one of the largest and most historically dominant teams in the games.

In honor of March Madness and my data collection project on college sports athletic attendance, I decided to compare average attendance at men's division 1 college basketball games for the five major conferences. I gathered data from 2010-2019 and it came from the NCAA's attendance records.

In creating my own map, I decided to look at the top 20 tallest buildings in the world. The data is from 2022 and althought not surprising, I hadn't considered that most of the world's tallest buildings are located in China, with there being only one in both the United States and Europe that made the list.
