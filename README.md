## Using Canva to illustrate Lehigh University academic trends. 

I decided to look at undergraduate enrollment based on what college students are in. I was able to find this information on the [Lehigh University 2021 University Profile](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf)

## Using Canva to illustrate the gender wage gap in professional sports
I am passionate about women's sports and equality and was interested in looking more into the salary comparison between male and female athletes. Even though some sports such as tennis and soccer have made incredible strides in gender equity, there are still many sports in which the gender wage discrepany is over 90%. The infographic below shows the wage differences in 5 of the major sports from the 2019-2020 seasons. The data was provided by [Adelphi University's sports management team](https://online.adelphi.edu/articles/male-female-sports-salary/)
